## **Problem Statement**
**Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.**

**Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings.** 

## Data Pipeline
1. Data Understanding:This step includes a general walk through over the dataset knowing the dimensions of the dataset, datatype, different features, Checking for          missing values.

2. Data Processing: At thsi stage i have dropped two column that had some null value and also were less relevant to the scope of our analysis, this is done to keep          our data set small and concise so that handling would be easy,looked forward to the outliers to keep our data free from any anomaly and hence found the price column      to skewed towards the right and for that purpose we used median values where the analysis is done on the basis of price.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is the critical process of performing the initial investigation on the data. So, through this we have        observed certain trends and dependencies and also drawn certain conclusions from the dataset that will be useful for further processing.

## Observations:
1. Manhattan as a neighbourhood group is the most expensive across all the room type whether it is Entire home/apt, private room or shared room.
2. Brooklyn is the second most expensive neighbourhood across Entire home/apt and Private rooms.
3. Entire home/apt in Manhattan are the most while  Brooklyn has the most number of  Private rooms type.
4. Though very less but Manhattan has the most number of  Shared rooms.
5. People choose Entire home/apt are a preferred room type to stay.
6. Almost 12500 people accommodated in airbnb for 1 day only.
7. Almost  3500 people used airbnb for almost a month and we can assume that this group might the one that used the private home/apt as room type.
9. Brooklyn has the maximum number of reviews out all the neighbourhood group followed by Manhattan.
10.Staten Island has the minimum numbers of reviews out of all the neighbourhood groups.
